## At a Glance
```python
from geoworkflow.core.pipeline import ProcessingPipeline

# Define workflow configuration
config = {
    "stages": ["clip", "align", "enrich"],
    "source_dir": "data/raw",
    "output_dir": "data/processed"
}

# Run pipeline
pipeline = ProcessingPipeline(config)
results = pipeline.run()
